## Wave_Propegation_2D
My foray into wave propegation on a 2d space. I am using the PixelGameEngine created by OneLoneCoder. 
I took some inspiration from the video below, though most of the code is my own.

Please support the OLC!

Download the code and run and compile it with your favorite compiler. 
Click the mouse to start the wave propegation and to place and unplace walls.
Ctrl click to move the end node and Shift click to move the starting node.
Press Q to increase the wave visualization and A to shrink it.
